This capstone project is going to be using the Transit API (https://transitapp.com/apis) and attempting to combine it with Weather Data to create a comprehensive dataset/visualization regarding the state of Public Transit in various cities. 

I will be aiming to produce a dataset that will allow someone to investigate how weather affects the public transit in the city of Toronto. 

Please note: I have requested access to the API which is still pending. I made this problem statement with the assumption I will have this data available. In case they do not grant me access, I will update this readme accordingly with a proposal.
